-----------------------------------------   Section 2.1
                pos      neg
            pos TP = 5  FP = 1
            neg FN = 5  TN = 99

Aint' good, so we cannot just trust the ACCURACY, indeed, we are gonna introduce RECALL and PRECISION

- RECALL = TP / (TP+FN) = 5/10 = 1/2 = 0.5%
- PRECISION = TP / (TP+FP) = 5/6 = 0.8% --> We can use this for checking

BANK

With Macro-Precision when we want high performance
Weighted-Precison = When I want to give different weights to the clsses , but he aint exlained about the micro Precison
Micro F1 (or macro? ----> I need to check) in multiclass classification is like ACCURACY

TF * IDF  = TF / DF 

Document 1 = the
Document 2 = the click
Document 3 = the
Document 4 = the 

We're analyzing the Document 2 :
Out of 100 words, 50 are "the", so
TF_the = 0.5
TF_click = 0.1
